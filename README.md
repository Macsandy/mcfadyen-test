# mcfadyen-test

Hello, this is my Magento test for McFadyen

I've created a custom theme called mcfadyentest under the mcfadyen vendor name.
It has Magento's blank theme as its parent theme, for basic inheritance.
In case needed on the following link, i've made available a .sql dump of my local project database, with a simple product and images already inserted so you can test away:
